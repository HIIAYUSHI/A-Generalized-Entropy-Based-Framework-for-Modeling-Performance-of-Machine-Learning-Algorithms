# A-Generalized-Entropy-Based-Framework-for-Modeling-Performance-of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project contains a set of **Jupyter notebooks** to help students and data scientists deeply understand and visualize the *four main classification metrics* used in machine learning: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score**.

## Notebooks Included

- `accuracyforreport-1.ipynb`
- `precisionforreport.ipynb`
- `recallforreport.ipynb`
- `f1forreport.ipynb`

Each notebook:
- Processes **popular classification datasets** (e.g., Diabetes, Iris)
- Performs **entropic analysis** for class/score distributions
- Compares **KNN and Logistic Regression**
- Generates detailed plots and summary tables

## How To Use

1. **Clone or download** this repository to your computer.
2. Place the included datasets (`Diabetes.csv`, `Iris.csv`, etc.) in the project folder.
3. Open notebooks with **Jupyter Notebook**, **JupyterLab**, or **Google Colab.**
4. **Run each notebook cell sequentially**—metrics, visualizations, and summary statistics will be computed and shown.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab or Google Colab
- Core packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`
